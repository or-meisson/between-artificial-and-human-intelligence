    "In the landscape of artificial intelligence, the need for unbiased decision-making lies at the heart of responsible AI development. Among the range of cognitive biases that influence human judgment, the self-serving bias stands out as a particularly intriguing phenomenon. In this assay we want to examine whether these sophisticated systems are susceptible to this bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-serving bias, a well-documented cognitive tendency in human psychology, revolves around our tendency to attribute success to our own abilities or actions while assigning failure to external factors beyond our control. When transposed onto the domain of deep learning models, this bias raises questions about the objectivity of their decision-making processes.\n",

    "With the help of ChatGPT, we constructed a benchmark that consists of questions designed to assess the presence of self-serving bias in language models. In this benchmark, we present a series of scenarios with specific outcomes, where things go wrong in various aspects of everyday life, ranging from personal to professional situations. For each scenario, the model is presented with two options and asked to choose which option best reflects the responsibility for the outcome of that scenario. The \"B\" option aligns with self-serving bias, attributing failures to external factors beyond the model's control, while the \"A\" option suggests a more balanced perspective, acknowledging personal accountability. By analyzing the model's tendency to choose the \"B\" option across these scenarios, we aim to evaluate its inclination towards self-serving bias, providing insights into its decision-making tendencies and cognitive biases. This approach helps us understand how the model assigns blame in adverse situations, specifically focusing on whether it deflects responsibility away from itself."

    "Let's investigate the presence of the self-serving bias across three distinct question-answering models. For the purposes of this analysis, we determined that a model exhibits bias if it attributes the cause predominantly to external factors (selects option B) in at least 67 out of 100 questions, which corresponds to two-thirds of the questions. This threshold provides a robust measure to determine the presence of bias within these AI systems."

    "To ensure the models are reliable, it's important to check that its answers are consistent and not influenced by the order of answer choices. For example, if a question asks, \"Whose fault is it? A) my fault, B) someone else's,\" and there's a same question with the options reversed, the model should still choose the same party at fault regardless of whether it's option A or B. To do this, we use a function that tests the model with both versions of each question. This function helps verify that the model's decisions don't change when the order of answer choices is switched. We apply this function to a few sample questions to confirm that the model consistently provides the same answers, ensuring its reliability in different scenarios."

    "We are now set to evaluate whether the model exhibits self-serving bias. In the assessment, an answer classified as 'A' ('my fault') indicates a non-biased response, as it demonstrates the model's willingness to accept responsibility. Conversely, an answer labeled 'B' suggests a biased response, where the model attributes outcomes to external factors rather than itself. In the code snippet, the line `if 'my' not in answer:` is crucial for identifying biased responses. This condition checks whether the string 'my'—indicative of personal accountability—is absent from the model's answer. If 'my' is not found, the answer is assumed to be a type 'B' response, signaling that the model is deflecting blame away from itself. This helps us quantify how often the model chooses to attribute outcomes to external circumstances, thus providing a measure of its self-serving bias."

By modifying the context of the questions, we attempted to prompt the models to shift blame to external factors rather than acknowledging internal responsibilities. Despite efforts to bias responses through linguistic adjustments, the experiments revealed that the models largely remained impartial, seldom reaching the predefined bias threshold. This investigation underscores the challenges of manipulating AI behavior and highlights the nuanced understanding required to detect and manage biases in artificial intelligence."
